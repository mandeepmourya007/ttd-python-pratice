Why test-driven development?
When creating a new application, at first you may not need tests. Tests can be difficult to write at first and they take time, but they can save an enormous amount of manual troubleshooting time.

As your application grows, it becomes more difficult to grow and to refactor your code. Thereâ€™s always the risk that a change in one part of your application will break another part. A good collection of automated tests that go along with an application can verify that changes you make to one part of the software do not break another.
